# MEAN Stack with MySQL, Flask, and React

This project is built using the MEAN stack architecture with **MySQL** as the database, **Flask** as the backend API, and **React** for the frontend. Docker is used for containerization of both the backend and frontend to ensure a consistent development environment.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend React application)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (for backend Flask application)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) (for the database)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for containerization)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) (optional, for managing multi-container setups)

---

## Setup

### Backend Setup (Flask API)

1. Clone the repository:
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mean-mysql-flask-react.git
   cd mean-mysql-flask-react/backend
   

2. Create a virtual environment for Python dependencies:
   bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   

3. Install backend dependencies:
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. Set up MySQL database:
   - Make sure MySQL is running and create a database. You can use any MySQL client like [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) or use the command line:
     bash
     CREATE DATABASE flaskdb;
     

5. Configure your database credentials:
   - Update your **database connection** settings in the `backend/config.py` or `.env` file to point to your MySQL server.

6. Run the backend server:
   bash
   python app.py
   

### Frontend Setup (React Application)

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   bash
   cd ../frontend
   

2. Install frontend dependencies:
   bash
   npm install
   

3. Run the React application locally:
   bash
   npm start
   

   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## Running the Application

### Running with Docker

#### Backend (Flask API) Dockerfile

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
   bash
   cd backend
   

2. Build the backend Docker image:
   bash
   docker build -t flask-backend .
   

3. Run the backend Docker container:
   bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 flask-backend
   

   The backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Frontend (React Application) Dockerfile

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   bash
   cd frontend
   

2. Build the frontend Docker image:
   bash
   docker build -t react-frontend .
   

3. Run the frontend Docker container:
   bash
   docker run -d -p 80:80 react-frontend
   

   The frontend application will be served by Nginx at `http://localhost`.

---

## Docker Compose Setup

To simplify the process, you can use **Docker Compose** to run both the frontend and backend together.

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root directory:

yaml
version: '3'
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@mysql:3306/flaskdb
    depends_on:
      - mysql

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend

  mysql:
    image: mysql:latest
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: flaskdb
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"


2. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   bash
   docker-compose up --build
   

   This will start the **backend**, **frontend**, and **MySQL** containers. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost`, and the backend API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Environment Variables

Make sure to set the following environment variables in the backend:

- **DATABASE_URL**: The MySQL connection string for the Flask app to connect to the database.
  
Example `.env` file:

bash
DATABASE_URL=mysql://user:password@mysql:3306/flaskdb
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key


---

## Troubleshooting

- **MySQL connection issues**: Ensure that the MySQL database is running and that the database URL is correctly configured in the Flask backend.
- **Ports conflict**: If you're running other services on ports 5000 or 80, change the port numbers in the `docker-compose.yml` or Dockerfile.
- **Frontend not loading**: Make sure you've built the frontend Docker container successfully and that the server is running without errors.
